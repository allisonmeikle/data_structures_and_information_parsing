This project is a caterpillar game simulation built in Java for Assignment 2. It involved implementing custom data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues) from scratch, parsing encoded strings, and managing game logic without using built-in collections. It demonstrates skills in object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithmic thinking.
